Currently there is no easy way to call a standard quick action from a lightning component/ another quick action/ button in lightning. 

Aim of this component is to solve the problem by using REST API to call a standard "SEND EMAIL" action from a custom lightning component

Credits to peterknolle (http://peterknolle.com/rest-api-lightning-component) I was able to extend his concept into a component that inputs the following from the user and sends an email and shows a success/ failure toast message

emailAddresses 
emailSubject
emailBody
